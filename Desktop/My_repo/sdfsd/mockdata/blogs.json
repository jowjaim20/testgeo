One such feature is Google Chrome‚Äôs extensions.",

Another great feature of Google Chrome is it‚Äôs simple configuration for your proxy setting!",
					"Proxy users, especially those who are new to the subject, may sometimes become confused when configuring a proxy server through different applications. Google Chrome makes it simple and straightforward when you‚Äôre configuring a proxy server through it, because it simply copies your system‚Äôs proxy settings. It doesn‚Äôt particularly need any additional settings to be configured for it to work.

It has Intelligent Tracking Prevention, that identifies trackers and prevents them from profiling or following you across the web. Safari notifies you if you enter any suspicious website. It also detects password breaches and automatically informs you if one did occur. But, this doesn't mean that it's unbreakable. You are still vulnerable especially if you frequent public places and connect to their wi-fi. It's useful to have a VPN or a proxy server running on your device every time you connect to any public wi-fi network.",

One of it‚Äôs only downsides is that all the additional settings might overwhelm users that are not very ‚Äútech savvy‚Äù.",

It has a multitude of built-in functionalities that offer full protection against malicious parties that other browsers only have limited protection against. One of these features is a Brave firewall + vpn combo that can protect anything you do online and even when you‚Äôre outside the browser.",
					"Even with all these features, you could still add another layer of protection for yourself. You can do this by installing a proxy server for your network and any wi-fi connection you use. A proxy server acts as an intermediary for the website and yourself so the website only sees the IP address of the proxy server and effectively protects yours.

					"One of the most widely known telecommunication apps in the world, Skype enables people from all around the world to communicate with each other. It was founded in 2003 and was acquired by Microsoft in 2011. At one point in time Skype was the most popular communication app but the rise of other apps have taken its place and became more successful than Skype. Nevertheless, Skype is still a juggernaut in its own right. It‚Äôs available for all devices so people can communicate through it no matter what they‚Äôre using or where they are in the world.",
					"Skype has a lot of features to help users around the world communicate with each other. In fact, two of its most notable features are Skype Translate, where conversations are automatically being translated to the users preferred language, and Live Subtitles, where there is a real time transcript appearing on screen when people are conferencing. To protect your privacy, Skype has also added end-to-end encryption so uninvited people can‚Äôt intercept your call. There‚Äôs still a way to further protect your privacy though and that is through installing a proxy server.",
					"A proxy server can help hide your IP address thus also masking your real location, similar to what a vpn does. This is also useful when you‚Äôre in a country that has banned Skype because a proxy server can enable you to use Skype within that country. The <a href='/use-cases/' target='_blank' class='text-link-200'>best proxies to use</a> for Skype would then be residential proxies as they are the most secure of proxies. If you just want to optimize Skype and make it run faster, then you can use datacenter proxies.",
					"<i>Note:It‚Äôs not recommended to use a free skype proxy. They‚Äôre usually unreliable and your sensitive information may be at risk of being intercepted.</i>",
					"To change your Skype proxy settings you have to configure a proxy server for your own system. Skype only copies your system‚Äôs proxy settings and utilizes it for Skype‚Äôs own use. The older version of Skype did allow you to set up an individual proxy server for Skype but it‚Äôs been removed in the newer versions.",

By heavily focusing on a person's lifestyle, Pinterest ensures that you will always have brand new ideas and sparks of inspiration to the things that you love. They show you new and different images based on what you post and what you search for.",

Instead of sharing your Pins to your friends, family, or followers, you would save all of them on your boards and you can even invite other like-minded people to pin on that board and find more ideas!",
					"The social network‚Äôs uniqueness has also influenced how marketers strategize for it. In Pinterest marketing, visual media is the king. It‚Äôs so heavily focused on images that words have less value than usual. To generate quality sales and traffic for their products, marketers have also resorted to using Pinterest proxies to enable a lot of the things that they want to do like bot automation.",
					"A Pinterest proxy network can help marketers create an unlimited number of Pinterest accounts with <a href='/what-is-my-ip/' target='_blank' class='text-link-200'>real IP addresses</a> from various different locations while avoiding bans. With the help of Pinterest bots, they can autopin images to various targeted boards which generates attention and engagement which leads to more traffic for their product. A Pinterest proxy would also let you scrape Pinterest freely and gather as much data as you want for your target audience. If you‚Äôve been banned, then you can also unblock Pinterest with a proxy.",

					"Known as a micro-blogging site, Twitter is a social media platform where its users can post micro-blogs which are referred to as ‚Äútweets‚Äù. It‚Äôs among the leading social networks worldwide with over 400 million users. The number of characters a user can use on a single tweet is limited to 280 so users are forced to have a short and clever use of their language.",
					"Remarkably, this imposed limit is what has made Twitter so popular. Even if the character restriction has made it challenging to write, it has also made scanning tweets brief and easy. You can follow friends and family or any twitter account you may find interesting and receive updates anytime they tweet something. Twitter has even become a source of daily news of what‚Äôs currently happening in the world because the people there are tweeting and retweeting about it. The people on Twitter have become mini-journalists in their own rights.",
					"Like any other popular social media, Twitter has also become a marketing tool for any business that wants to advertise their products or services. The problem is that a single account is not enough to successfully do so. Any individual or company always requires multiple Twitter accounts to succeed in marketing their products and reaching their target audience. They would then be met by another problem which is that Twitter bans accounts that are using the same IP address. Luckily, this can be bypassed with the use of a Twitter proxy.",
					"Twitter proxies work by hiding your personal IP address and masking it with its own IP address. This enables marketers to create an unlimited number of accounts with real IP addresses from various different locations basically preventing their accounts from being banned. By using Twitter bots, they can now do web scraping for any information they want from their target audience or competitors and drive engagements for their brands and products.",

					"What made Amazon so successful was that it had built the best customer service. Amazon focuses on three core values that give customers the best experience when they‚Äôre shopping online: 1) a large catalog of products, 2) low prices, and 3) fast delivery. A large selection of products gives customers a lot of options to choose from with each product having low prices and a fast, sometimes even same day delivery that assures customers will keep coming back for more.",

Through scraping methods, marketers and business professionals use Amazon to gather relevant data on it‚Äôs products which allows them to know customers‚Äô preferences and behaviors. Amazon does ban any visitor‚Äôs IP address if it does this. So, it‚Äôs very important for marketers to have a great Amazon proxy server when scraping to avoid being banned.",

This enables people to use bots or any other automation tool to scrape for data without being banned. Does Amazon check for proxies? Absolutely. In fact, when scraping Amazon and it detects that a scrape is happening, then it might just feed you false product information. That‚Äôs why scrapers need great Amazon scraping proxies to successfully do it on Amazon - you need to know what you‚Äôre doing.",
					"The best proxies for Amazon are residential proxies. Residential proxies use millions of rotating IP‚Äôs from actual people in different locations, so the likelihood of you getting banned is close to zero. It‚Äôs not recommended to use datacenter proxies because if the subnet has been banned, your thousands of proxies would not matter.",

It‚Äôs the 19th most popular website in the world and it‚Äôs huge user base ensures that there‚Äôs always a community, also known as a subreddit, for everything. Reddit accounts are free, and it‚Äôs users can post anything that is related to their respective communities. What makes Reddit different from other social media sites is that people can ‚Äúupvote‚Äù anything they like and also ‚Äúdownvote‚Äù anything they dislike.",

Manually doing so would be inefficient, which results in them using reddit bots for automation to quickly get what they want. A problem is that doing so can easily get them flagged and banned by Reddit and the best way to prevent this from happening would be using Reddit proxies.",
					"Reddit proxies work by acting as an intermediary between your personal IP address and Reddit. Reddit can only see the IP address of the reddit proxy which also increases your own security and privacy. Through Reddit proxies, marketers or web scrapers can easily use bots for Reddit and avoid any bans that normally come their way. If your IP address has been banned by a particular subreddit, you can also use proxies to get around this but a VPN may be better for such a case.",
					"The best Reddit proxies would be residential proxies. Residential proxies for Reddit would ensure that you would never get flagged and banned whenever you‚Äôre scraping or doing anything with bots. Residential proxies use millions of real IP addresses from actual people located in various different countries making your bots appear as actual people to Reddit. You can also use datacenter proxies because Reddit isn‚Äôt as strict towards bots compared to the other social media platforms.",

					"Tiktok is a popular social media platform that has become the most searched term worldwide surpassing Google. It‚Äôs an application that allows its users to create, watch, discover, and share short videos where the duration ranges from 15 seconds to three minutes. It‚Äôs mostly used on mobile devices and its popularity widely stems from its ability to make the users feel comfortable and excitedly engage with others on the platform.",
					"For its users to fully optimize Tiktok, they will have to use a Tiktok proxy especially if they‚Äôre marketers or content creators that are looking to make their videos go viral. A Tiktok proxy provides users with benefits that include, but are not limited to: Unblocking Tiktok from countries that have it banned, increasing their privacy and security by hiding their own IP addresses, and allowing the use of Tiktok bots to <a href='/use-cases/social-media/' target='_blank' class='text-link-200'>create multiple tiktok accounts</a> and automate activities without being banned.",
					"Tiktok automation bots allow people using it to watch, like, comment, and follow a specific account at a massive scale, which can increase engagements and traffic for that specific account. Unfortunately, Tiktok has a strict anti-spam policy and bans any account that‚Äôs caught doing so. It‚Äôs the reason why excellent Tiktok proxies are needed if you don‚Äôt want to get flagged and banned.",
					"The best Tiktok proxy would be a residential proxy. Residential proxies are linked to actual locations because it uses real residential IP addresses from actual people. This effectively minimizes the chances of you getting banned. You can also use datacenter proxies which are faster but less reliable compared to residential proxies. You can get away with this because Tiktok isn‚Äôt as strict with its anti-spam policy compared to other social network sites but there‚Äôs still a chance for a Tiktok ban to happen.",

This issue is called the ‚ÄúHulu proxy error‚Äù and will disappear if you disable your proxy server.

					"A multinational e-commerce platform, eBay is famous for being an online auction site and having direct consumer to consumer sales. It was founded in 1995 and has become one of the safest places online to sell and purchase any products. Users can search for any product that is available locally, nationally, and internationally.",
					"eBay‚Äôs popularity has attracted the attention of marketers looking to gather or scrape huge quantities of data to collect a product‚Äôs information, prices, and reviews. To accomplish this, they need scraping tools but the moment that eBay notices scrapers or scraping tools, eBay will immediately ban the account caught doing so. To go around this, you need an eBay proxy.",
					"An eBay proxy works as a gateway for your device and eBay. This hides your <a href='/what-is-my-ip/' target='_blank' class='text-link-200'>your personal IP address</a> and allows eBay to only see the IP address of the proxy server. With the help of Geonode‚Äôs residential proxies, you can scrape freely without the fear of being banned. Residential proxies use real IP addresses with varying geo-locations making your bots appear as actual people. It‚Äôs possible for you to create multiple new accounts each with different IP addresses. With eBay‚Äôs strict policy against bots and spam, you really need an exceptional residential proxy service and that‚Äôs where Geonode comes into play.",
					"<i>Note: Datacenter proxies are faster but the chances of you getting banned becomes much higher. It‚Äôs simply not worth the risk.</i>",
					"eBay proxies also have additional benefits such as unlocking location restrictions on eBay by choosing which location you want to be, being able to sell anonymously on eBay and protect your personal information from hackers, and unblocking eBay when your account has been banned or you have a blacklisted IP address. You can also do ‚ÄúeBay proxy bidding‚Äù, where you can let bots automatically bet on multiple products if you want to.",

So if you‚Äôre a marketer looking to tap into a target audience in a different location or even someone simply looking to interact with people in a different city, then you need a vpn or a Craigslist proxy to change your location and enable you to do this. A Craigslist proxy is especially useful to marketers or scrapers that also want to scrape data from Craigslist or post multiple ads on it.",
					"A Craigslist proxy hides your personal IP address and only shows it‚Äôs own IP address to Craigslist. An excellent Craigslist proxy provider would have millions of IPs in their proxy pool, which ensures that you use a new IP every time it rotates. This allows you to bypass any restrictions you have with your single IP address without the repercussions of getting banned or an IP block.",
					"The best kind of proxies for Craigslist would be residential proxies. <a href='/residential-proxies/' target='_blank' class='text-link-200'>Residential proxies</a> use real residential IP addresses from your chosen location. Rotating proxies assure that you won‚Äôt get any bans for your account even when you‚Äôve been recognized. It‚Äôs also possible to use datacenter proxies, which are faster compared to residential proxies, but will also increase the likelihood of you getting banned as it‚Äôs not as secure compared to residential proxies.",

You also can‚Äôt purchase lots of tickets for a large group as Ticketmaster limits the number of tickets a single account can purchase. If you accidentally purchased too many tickets, then Ticketmaster will immediately ban your account and IP address. This has forced many users into using ticketing proxies when purchasing in Ticketmaster.",

You need to use your proxies effectively and only the best Ticketmaster proxies will work on it. Free proxies and even shared private proxies from random Ticketmaster proxy sites will not work as they are, most likely, already banned on Ticketmaster‚Äôs database.

				"metaDescription": "Freely browse through 4chan even if you've been banned using a 4chan proxy! Bypass any ban you may have gotten and we'll show you how to do it!",
				"descriptions": [
					"4chan is an imageboard website with a focus towards user anonymity. It has different forums called ‚Äúboards‚Äù that are dedicated to various topics ranging from anime to sports and even literature. There are 900,000 daily posts on these boards from its over 20 million unique monthly users. There are no accounts on 4chan and the platform is known for its few rules and fewer consequences - when compared to other websites.",
					"One of the ‚Äúadvantages‚Äù a user will have on 4chan is facing an account ban since there are no accounts needed to use the platform. However, bans are still possible as 4chan can block a user's IP address. You can get banned for breaking 4chan‚Äôs rules or simply because a moderator doesn‚Äôt like what you posted or commented. A ban on your IP address means you can‚Äôt access 4chan on your device anymore. The only way you can navigate through this is 4chan proxies to bypass that block.",
					"A 4chan proxy acts as an intermediary between your device and the internet. This means that any website you visit, including 4chan, will only see the IP address of the proxy server and never your own. This enables access to 4chan because it thinks that you‚Äôre a different user now. This doesn't mean you can just use any free proxies that are available online because those IPs that they‚Äôre using are, most likely, already banned by 4chan. This is even true for vpns, as IPs of the most famous vpn services are also likely banned already because so many users are using them. Proxies are the best way to go.",
					"The best type of proxy for bypassing a 4chan ban would be residential proxies. <a href='/residential-proxies/' target='_blank' class='text-link-200'>Residential proxies</a> use real IP addresses from actual devices making you appear as a different, authentic user. With rotating proxies, you can appear as a new user each time with a new IP address. You can also use datacenter proxies but the chances of it‚Äôs subnet getting banned is high.",
					"Proxies can also help you increase your security and privacy even on 4chan, which is famous for its anonymity. You can even unblock 4chan on countries that have banned it, like Australia and New Zealand.",
					"Let‚Äôs set up a proxy server for 4chan."

					"An online platform dedicated for employment purposes, LinkedIn is a place where users can develop their careers or businesses whether it be for job seekers to find a job or companies to find new employees. Users can save connections to form their own professional networks and promote their services or skills through their LinkedIn profile. It has over 65 million users and can be used through any web browser or its mobile app.",
					"With its large user base, whether it‚Äôs for business or analysis, gathering various data on its users would become a huge undertaking. It would take a lot of time and manual effort. The best way to effectively do this, is to scrape data from the entire platform through bots. Bot automation can quickly streamline the entire process of collecting data. The problem is that LinkedIn, like many other social media platforms, doesn‚Äôt like the use of bots or scrapers in its site and bans any account caught using one.",
					"So, to effectively and safely scrape LinkedIn, you need the help of LinkedIn proxies. Proxies act as an intermediary between your device and the internet. This means that any website you visit will only be able to see the proxy server‚Äôs IP address and it will not be able to see your own IP address. With rotating proxies, everytime your bot sends a request to LinkedIn, the request would come through a different IP on a set time making it hard for LinkedIn to discover you're using a bot and ban you.",
					"The best proxies to use for LinkedIn would be <a href='/residential-proxies/' target='_blank' class='text-link-200'>residential proxies</a>. These types of proxies use residential IP addresses from actual devices, making your bots appear as if they were ‚Äúreal‚Äù users with an actual IP address. Proxies are also useful when you want to create and manage multiple LinkedIn accounts, increase your anonymity, and safely access any website.",

					"Khan Academy is a non-profit organization that focuses on educating anyone willing to learn and it‚Äôs free of charge. Khan Academy provides online courses with world-class education and offers practice tutorials, interactive software, instructional videos, and even your own personalized dashboard. Learners have a wide variety of courses to choose from while learning at their own pace. There is also no limit to the amount of courses you can take and there are multiple languages available including Spanish, French, and Brazilian Portuguese.",
					"To optimize using Khan Academy, utilizing a proxy will be of great advantage to you. Proxies act as an intermediary between your device and the internet. Any website you visit will only see the IP address and location of the proxy server you‚Äôre using and never your own information. The best proxies for Khan Academy depend on <a href='/use-cases/' target='_blank' class='text-link-200'>what you want to use it for</a>.",
					"For example, if your network is slow or lagging, proxies can help improve your internet connection. Datacenter proxies are the fastest proxies available and you‚Äôll be connecting to the most reliable servers. This helps in giving you a smoother experience when using Khan Academy and any other website.",
					"The best way to go around this problem is to use ticket bots and ticket proxies for Viagogo. Viagogo, along with the other ticket websites, have an extremely strict policy against the use of bots. It would immediately ban an account caught using any automation tool. This is because bots can expedite the checkout process and proxies can enable a large number of purchases.",
					"If you want security and anonymity more, then <a href='/residential-proxies/' target='_blank' class='text-link-200'>residential proxies</a> would be better for you. Although slower than datacenter proxies, residential proxies use actual residential IPs from real devices making it seem as if you‚Äôre a different user. Residential proxies are also helpful when you want to do other activities such as using a bot to web scrape any website and avoid being flagged and blocked by the website.",

It has over 500 million users worldwide, hosted on Amazon web services (AWS), and is one of the most downloaded language learning mobile applications in the app store.",

					"A proxy acts as a gateway between your device and the internet. Any website you visit would only be able to see the IP address of the proxy server and never your own. This lets you protect your data and devices from hackers and anonymously browse the internet. Proxies also lets you avoid geo-restrictions, like accessing Duolingo from countries that have banned it, and enable the use of bots or any other automation tool without being flagged and banned. ",

If you want more security and reliably change your location then residential proxies are for you but if you want speed and a faster connection then datacenter proxies are the best way to go.

					"Vimeo is a video hosting and sharing platform where users can upload and share high-quality videos either for entertainment purposes or sharing their talent to the world. Users can also do live streaming for their audiences. There are no ads in Vimeo, they gain their revenue through subscription plans and software services they offer to their users. If you don‚Äôt want to avail those subscriptions but still want to use Vimeo, then you can subscribe to their basic and free membership. Vimeo is available on multiple platforms including a Vimeo app for mobile devices.",
					"There‚Äôs a lot of content that can be found on Vimeo, but it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that all that content is available for you. Video creators or publishers will sometimes post a video that‚Äôs locked to a particular location. For example, you live in New York and a European creator posted a video that is locked to only Europe. You won‚Äôt be able to see that video. The only way you can see that video is if you change your location and this can be done with either a vpn or a Vimeo proxy. ",
					"Proxies act as a gateway between your device and the internet. Any website you visit would only be able to see the IP address of the proxy server. This means that you can change your location based on the IP address the proxy server is using. If you change your location to Europe, any website you visit would see that you‚Äôre from Europe. You will be able to change your location and gain access to all Vimeo videos. ",
					"There are also a lot of other <a href='/use-cases/' target='_blank' class='text-link-200'>helpful uses for proxies</a>. If the country or the network you‚Äôre using has banned Vimeo, then you can unblock Vimeo through a proxy and enable you to access it. A creator can also use proxies to utilize automation tools and help upload multiple videos at the same time without getting banned. Proxies also help protect your personal information and give you total anonymity when browsing the internet.",

This allows your SoundCloud automation bot to have a different IP address each time it reposts your music.

It‚Äôs an application that‚Äôs available on mobile devices and built specifically for Android and iOS. Users don‚Äôt have to create an account to view videos on Periscope but you do need a Periscope account if you want to comment, share, chat, and heart a video. You can use your twitter account or your mobile phone number to do this.",

It would be basically impossible to browse Periscope anonymously without external help. A Periscope proxy setup would be needed if you want to protect your privacy. ",
					"Proxies act as a gateway between your mobile device and the internet. This means that any website you visit would only be able to see the IP address of the proxy server and never your own. This effectively protects you from being tracked down via your IP address and shields any blocks from happening to your account. ",
					"There are also many other <a href='/use-cases/' target='_blank' class='text-link-200'>useful cases of a proxy</a> for Periscope. It would help you avoid any IP ban on your account. You can automate your social media activities and manage multiple Periscope accounts without getting banned by Periscope‚Äôs anti-bot policy. If you live in a location that has banned Periscope, then you can also change your location through a proxy. Proxies also enables you to browse Periscope anonymously and fully protect your internet privacy.",

If you‚Äôre a free user on Tinder though, then you will only be able to connect for 30 days and you can‚Äôt view profiles that aren‚Äôt from your country unless you subscribe to their premium packages.",
					"Users that want to <a href='/use-cases/social-media/' target='_blank' class='text-link-200'>create multiple accounts</a> and automate Tinder functions such as liking, connecting and chatting with other Tinder users will be restricted by Tinder‚Äôs policies. There‚Äôs a limit to how many accounts you can create on a single IP and the use of Tinder bots are banned. To bypass these restrictions or have Tinder unblocked, then you will need the help of a Tinder proxy. ",
					"A Tinder proxy works the same way as a regular proxy in that it shields your device‚Äôs IP address from any website you visit or any application you use that connects to the internet. It will only be able to see the IP address of the proxy server and your own IP address will be protected. You can change the IP address the proxy server is using and even have it periodically change using rotating proxies. This means that any new Tinder account you create would have a different IP and also the fact that Tinder will not be able to recognize that you‚Äôre using bot automation since the requests from your bot would look like it comes from ‚Äúreal‚Äù users.",
					"If you‚Äôve been banned by Tinder and you‚Äôre asking how to get around a Tinder ban then proxies can also help you on this. You would be able to use a different IP address from your banned one so you would be able to have Tinder unblocked. <a href='/residential-proxies/' target='_blank' class='text-link-200'>Residential proxies</a> are the best proxies to use as these types of proxies use actual residential IPs from actual devices making it almost impossible for any website to detect that you‚Äôre using a proxy.",

					"Yahoo Mail is an online email service that‚Äôs known to be one of the earliest email service providers in the world. Similar to Gmail, Yahoo Mail provides users with all the basic Yahoo mail services like sending and receiving emails or blocking spam. It‚Äôs free to create a Yahoo Mail account and you can access it via a web browser or its mobile app. As of 2020, Yahoo Mail has 225 million active monthly users.",
					"Despite its security implementations, Yahoo Mail has experienced its fair share of security breaches. So, it‚Äôs recommended to increase your security and protect the privacy of your Yahoo email account. One of the best ways to protect your digital identity when browsing Yahoo Mail is to use a Yahoo Mail proxy.",
					"A proxy acts as an intermediary between your device and the internet so any website you visit or application you use that connects to the internet would only be able to see the IP address of the proxy server and never your own IP. Through rotating proxies and a massive proxy pool, you can continuously change the IP address of the proxy server on a given time interval. With proxies, you gain a protective shield that safeguards you from users with malicious intent and also gives you total anonymity when browsing the internet.",
					"A Yahoo Mail proxy also has a number of <a href='/use-cases/' target='_blank' class='text-link-200'>other use cases</a>. For example, if you want to automate creating and managing multiple accounts on your device. As Yahoo Mail limits the number of accounts a single IP address can make but with a Yahoo Mail proxy, you can create a new account with a different IP address each time. This allows you to create as many accounts as you want and effectively use your bot without getting banned.",
					"The best Yahoo Mail proxy to use would be <a href='/residential-proxies/' target='_blank' class='text-link-200'>residential proxies</a> as these types of proxies use real residential IPs from actual devices making it difficult to notice that you‚Äôre using a proxy. Datacenter proxies, although faster than residential proxies, aren‚Äôt secure enough to prevent websites from noticing that you‚Äôre using a bot or proxy. It‚Äôs also not recommended to use free proxies from random Yahoo proxy sites as these proxies are unreliable and may already be banned by most websites.",

					"Bing is Microsoft‚Äôs own, self-operated web search engine and is the latest iteration of Microsoft‚Äôs search engines. Bing is the default search engine for a lot of devices. Compared to Google, Bing‚Äôs searches are more specialized towards images and videos while Google has more of an all-around strength. Bing is free to use and is available in more than 40 languages. Bing also has a mobile app for phone users with millions of downloads even though most users still search via browsers.",
					"As with any popular search engine, Bing has an abundance of valuable data which digital marketers and SEOs need. To <a href='/use-cases/search-engine-crawling/' target='_blank' class='text-link-200'>gather all of that data</a> though would take months or even years to complete. The best way to accomplish this task is to use a scraper to collect all that information. The problem is that scraping data while using a bot is against the policies of most websites including Bing. Once your bot is detected, Bing would immediately ban your IP address and you can‚Äôt access Bing again. To bypass these restrictions, you would need the help of a Bing proxy.",
					"Bing proxies are simply regular proxies that act as an intermediary between your device and the internet. Any website you visit would only be able to see the IP address of the proxy server and your own IP address would be hidden. You can even change this IP address many times and on a set interval through rotating proxies. There are even millions of IPs you can use. This means that, as you scrape Bing, all the requests that your bot makes would appear as if they were coming from different computers with varying locations.",
					"The best Bing proxy to use would be residential proxies as these types of proxies use residential IPs from actual devices making your bot appear as a real ‚Äúuser‚Äù. Bing, or any website in fact, would not be able to recognize that you‚Äôre using a bot and now you can scrape as freely as you want.",
					"Let‚Äôs set up a Bing proxy server.",
					"<i>Note: Make sure that the web browser you‚Äôre using for Bing is set to automatically copy your computer‚Äôs proxy settings. Google Chrome automatically does this, so it‚Äôs recommended to use it. </i>"

					"VK, also known as VKontakte, is a social media platform and a social network service that‚Äôs mainly used by Russian-based audiences. VK is the most popular website in Russia with more than 640 million users since it was created. Although VK is available in multiple languages, it‚Äôs still mainly used by Russian speaking users. It has all the functions of a social media and you can even play some browser-based games on it.",
					"Marketers use VK to do marketing projects and outreaches, like any other social media website. They would <a href='/use-cases/social-media/' target='_blank' class='text-link-200'>create multiple VK accounts</a> and use bots to manage and automate their account activities like liking, commenting, and sharing. VK has a strict policy against the use of bots and also limits the number of accounts a single IP address can create though, so you will need the help of a VK proxy to avoid being banned or blocked.",
					"A VK proxy acts as an intermediary between your device and the internet. So any web page you visit will only be able to see the IP address of the proxy server. With the help of rotating proxies, you can even change this IP address at a set interval multiple times. There are millions of IPs you can use and this makes it so that any requests your bot makes would use a different IP address. VK would be deceived into thinking that your bot‚Äôs requests are coming from different users.",
					"The best VK proxy to use would be <a href='/residential-proxies/' target='_blank' class='text-link-200'>residential proxies</a>. These types of proxies use real residential IPs from actual devices which effectively makes your bot appear as if it were a ‚Äúreal‚Äù user. It‚Äôs not advised to use a free proxy too, as free proxies are already banned and blacklisted by most popular social media sites including VK.",
					"Some countries, like China and Ukraine, are restricted from accessing VK so users there will not be able to access it, even if you‚Äôre just visiting. Even your internet connection may be blocking your access to VK. A proxy can help you bypass these restrictions and unblock VK.",

Although Tidal was originally owned by a Swedish company, Aspiro, it‚Äôs now majority-owned by an American company named Block. Tidal Music is available for free but users can gain access to higher quality audio by subscribing to their higher tier subscriptions. Compared to other music streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music, Tidal‚Äôs highest tier subscription has the highest audio quality and sound quality but it does cost more.",
					"Tidal Music has over 70 million tracks, 250 thousand videos, and lots of user playlists. So, if you want to <a href='/use-cases/web-data-extraction/' target='_blank' class='text-link-200'>scrape valuable data</a> from Tidal then you would need to use a scraper bot as manually doing so would take too much time and effort. Although using a bot would save you so much hours and energy, Tidal Music has a strict anti-bot system that will immediately ban your IP address if it recognizes that you‚Äôre using a bot. The best way to circumvent this policy is to use a Tidal Music proxy.",
					"Tidal Music proxies are simply regular proxies that work as a gateway between your device and the internet. Any website you visit or application you use will only be able to see the IP address of the proxy server and never your own IP address. By constantly changing the IP address of your bot through rotating proxies, you can mislead Tidal Music into thinking that your bot‚Äôs requests are coming from different people with various locations instead of it coming from a single IP address. This enables you to scrape without restrictions and not be afraid of being banned.",
					"As Tidal Music is only available in 61 countries, a Tidal Music proxy is also useful for bypassing geographical restrictions if you live in a region that has no access to Tidal Music. Even if you‚Äôre just visiting those regions, you still won‚Äôt be able to access Tidal and play music.",
					"The best Tidal Music proxies to use would be either <a href='/residential-proxies/' target='_blank' class='text-link-200'>residential proxies</a> or datacenter proxies, depending on what you want. If you want full assurance that your bot won‚Äôt be banned by Tidal Music while giving you total anonymity, then residential proxies are the one for you. If you value speed and want a faster way to scrape data, then datacenter proxies are what‚Äôs best for you.",

				"descriptions": [
					"Tokopedia is an Indonesian-based, <a href='/use-cases/ecommerce/' target='_blank' class='text-link-200'>e-commerce platform</a> provider for both merchants and buyers. Their marketplace helps sellers reach a wider range of potential buyers as Tokopedia covers most of Indonesia‚Äôs districts. Similar to other marketplaces like Amazon or Alibaba, buyers are given a wide variety of products to choose from clothes and bags to computers and laptops. Official stores from well-known brands are even available in Tokopedia.",
					"As a popular and profitable marketplace, there is a great deal of valuable data and information there that marketers want. However, manually web scraping individual webpages would take a lot of time and effort without the help of a bot scraper. A bot will do the scraping for you at a much faster rate compared to you manually doing it. The problem with using a bot though is the fact that most websites have a strict policy against the use of bots. When a website, including Tokopedia, recognizes that you‚Äôre using a bot then it would immediately ban and block your IP address. You can never access the website again, making your bot useless.",
					"The best way to bypass these restrictions is to use a Tokopedia proxy. A Tokopedia proxy will act as a gateway between your device and the internet so any website you visit will only be able to see the IP address of the proxy server you‚Äôre using and your own IP address will be hidden and can never be seen. Through rotating proxies, you can even change this IP address at a set interval.",
					"By continuously rotating IPs from the proxy pool of your proxy service, your bot will have a different IP address each time it sends a request to Tokopedia or any other website. This deceives Tokopedia into thinking that each of those requests comes from different users from various locations. Tokopedia will not be able to realize that you‚Äôre using a bot and therefore, will not ban you or your bot.",
					"Tokopedia proxies are also useful in <a href='/use-cases/' target='_blank' class='text-link-200'>many other cases</a>.  It‚Äôs helpful for both buyers and sellers if they want to protect their information and privacy from hackers or spies. Tokopedia proxies will give those users total anonymity when browsing the online marketplace especially if they‚Äôre connecting to a public WiFi network",
					"Let‚Äôs set up a Tokopedia proxy server.",
					"<i>Note: A reminder to make sure that the web browser you‚Äôre using for Tokopedia is set to automatically copy your system‚Äôs proxy settings. It‚Äôs recommended to use Google Chrome because it automatically does this.</i>"

Property24 has over 300,00 listings that can be found there making it the largest property website in the country. You don‚Äôt need an account if you just want to browse through their listings but you do need one if you want to post a listing. When browsing for a listing, you can choose from a variety of filters like which city or suburb, its street name, and many more.",

This information might be about prices of homes for sale or rent, its location, size, and many more. Even one person or homeowner looking to gauge the real estate market would find all of that information important. Manually scraping the website for all of that information though would take a lot of time and energy. To streamline this process, you would need the help of a scraper bot and let it do the job for you.",
					"A scraper bot is a quick and easy way to extract any data from Property24 and any other website for that matter. The problem is that the use of bots are heavily restricted by most websites. If a website detects that you‚Äôre using a bot, your IP address will be immediately banned and prevented access from that site again. The only way to bypass this restriction is to use a Property24 proxy.",
					"Property24 proxies will hide your IP address from the internet and any website you visit will only be able to see the IP address of the proxy server. By continuously changing IP addresses through rotating proxies, you can make it seem like your bot traffic is actually human traffic. By using the best Property24 proxies, which are <a href='/residential-proxies/' target='_blank' class='text-link-200'>residential proxies</a>, you can deceive any website into thinking that your bot is actually a different user each time it makes a request.",

					"Dailymotion is a video-sharing platform where users can find and watch all kinds of videos. It is the second largest and most popular video-sharing website in the world, second only to Youtube. As a watcher, there are a ton of videos for you to watch and consume and as a content creator, you can publish videos you create and you can even live stream as well.",
					"A drawback of Dailymotion though is that it is only available in 44 countries. If you‚Äôre not in one of those countries, then you will not be able to access Dailymotion. The best way you‚Äôre accessing Dailymotion is through utilizing a vpn or a Dailymotion proxy. A Dailymotion proxy will act as an intermediary between your device and the internet. This means that any website you visit will only be able to see the IP address of the proxy server you‚Äôre using.",
					"So, through geo-targeting, you can choose an IP address that‚Äôs located in a country that has access to Dailymotion. For example you have a Russian IP so you can‚Äôt access Dailymotion, you can then use a Dailymotion proxy to change your IP to an American IP. This lets you unblock Dailymotion and you can now watch all the trending and new Dailymotion videos. This is also applicable if your internet connection or network has banned Dailymotion. You can get around the network‚Äôs firewall and watch Dailymotion.",
					"Dailymotion proxies also have many <a href='/use-cases/' target='_blank' class='text-link-200'>other use cases</a>. If you want to protect and strengthen the security of your privacy and personal information, then a Dailymotion proxy would help you immensely.

Even if Quickbooks is mainly geared towards small and medium sized businesses, there are many plans and versions that would fit towards mostly everyone including freelancer or independent contractors.",

The best way to gain access to Quickbooks no matter where you are in the world is to use a Quickbook proxy.",

Any of your requests will be done via the proxy server so websites you visit will only be able to see the IP address of the proxy server and never your own.

This is especially useful when you have to transfer huge amounts of data and have to do a lot of uploading and downloading files.",

It is the largest and most widely used encyclopedia in the world and is regularly at the top of the most popular websites on the internet.

Even though it is the most read reference work in the world, schools and institutions cite Wikipedia as an unreliable source because anyone can edit the articles within it.",

Manually scraping each individual Wikipedia web page though would take a lot of time and effort. In fact, with over 56 million articles on Wikipedia, it is near impossible for a single person to scrape those pages one-by-one. This is why users utilize a Wikipedia scraper bot.",
					"A Wikipedia bot will automatically scrape through the Wikipedia pages and gather all that information for you. A Wikipedia bot alone isn‚Äôt enough though, as you need to pair it with a Wikipedia proxy. Most websites have a strict restriction against the use of bots on their website and would immediately ban any account caught using one. A Wikipedia proxy would disguise your bot to appear as if it were a real user which prevents you from getting banned and lets you <a href='/use-cases/web-scraping/' target='_blank' class='text-link-200'>scrape any website</a> you want.",

This means that websites will only see the IP address of the proxy server and not your own.

					"The Apple Store is Apple‚Äôs official website for all of its products and it is one of the best places where customers can purchase those products. The Apple Store is also heavily personalized based on the individual, the Apple products they already own, and even where they're from. As it‚Äôs Apple‚Äôs official store, you won‚Äôt get tricked into buying something that has incorrect information about it.",
					"As previously said, the Apple Store‚Äôs heavy personalization also includes where the user is from. Users from different countries would have a distinct type of content that is displayed to them. Items that are available in one country may not be available in another country. The only exception to this is for users in the United States as all Apple products are available in the US and even new Apple devices are released there first.",
					"The best way to bypass these limitations and gain access to all Apple products is to change your IP address to a US IP through the use of an Apple Store proxy. An Apple Store proxy will act as an intermediary between your device and the internet. All of your requests will be done via the proxy server so any website you visit will only be able to see the IP address of the proxy server you‚Äôre using. Your own IP address will be hidden making it pretty simple to deceive websites into thinking you actually have a US IP.",
					"For the best Apple Store proxies to use, <a href='/residential-proxies/' target='_blank' class='text-link-200'>residential proxies</a> are the most reliable types to utilize as these types of proxies use real residential IPs from actual devices making it near impossible for websites to recognize the fact that you‚Äôre using a proxy.

Yandex Browser is based on the Chromium open source project and it is available and easy to install for nearly all devices.",

					"Facebook is the most popular social media platform in the world with more than 2.80 million users. It has added a feature which allows companies or businesses to post job hirings or vacancies on their Facebook page which is aptly named Facebook Jobs. Although it doesn‚Äôt compete with the top platforms for job searching like LinkedIn or Indeed, it‚Äôs still good enough to garner a look sometime.",
					"Facebook Jobs has a lot of valuable data that can be gathered and used for a variety of tasks, whether it be for business or analysis. Manually scraping all of that data though would take a lot of time and effort without the help of a scraper bot. The problem is that Facebook has dedicated systems to recognize bot activity and would immediately ban any account caught using one. To prevent getting banned and blocked when scraping Facebook Jobs, you would need the help of a Facebook Jobs proxy.",
					"A Facebook Jobs proxy would act as a gateway between your device and the internet. All of your web requests will be handled by the proxy server so any website you visit would only be able to see the IP address of the proxy server and not your own. Through continuously rotating millions of IP addresses, all of your scraper bot‚Äôs requests would have a different IP address making your bot look like a normal user and prevent you from getting banned.",
					"The best Facebook Jobs proxies would be <a href='/residential-proxies/' class='text-link-200'>residential proxies</a> as these types of proxies use residential IPs from actual devices which completely deceives any website, including Facebook, into thinking that your bot‚Äôs requests are from genuine users. Datacenter proxies, although faster than residential proxies, aren‚Äôt secure and reliable enough to not be detected and banned by Facebook.",
					"Let‚Äôs set up a Facebook Jobs proxy server.",
					"<i>Note: Make sure that the web browser you‚Äôre using for Facebook Jobs is set to automatically copy your computer‚Äôs proxy settings. Google Chrome automatically does this, so it‚Äôs recommended to use it.</i>"

Minecraft‚Äôs popularity can be largely attributed to the simplicity of the game and the freedom it gives to its players. There is no real final objective to the game but there are a lot of tasks the player can do like crafting weapons or defeating the ender dragon.",
					"When playing Minecraft, there are many reasons as to why you might need to change your location. For example, the network you‚Äôre using has blocked playing Minecraft on their server. You need to change your IP and switch your location to bypass these restrictions. The best way to do so would be through a Minecraft proxy.",
					"A Minecraft proxy will handle all of your web requests for you so any website or application you use would only be able to see the IP address of the proxy server and not your own. You can easily change the IP address of the proxy server and choose any location you want in the world. As Minecraft also releases versions or updates that are region locked like the Minecraft Earth version, you can change your location to where that version is available and be able to play it.",
					"The best and most reliable Minecraft proxies you can use are <a href='/residential-proxies/' class='text-link-200'>residential proxies</a> as these types of proxies use actual residential IPs from real devices making it almost impossible to be detected and banned. You can also use datacenter proxies for Minecraft but do keep in mind that, although they‚Äôre faster compared to residential proxies, they are a lot less reliable and are more prone to being banned.",
