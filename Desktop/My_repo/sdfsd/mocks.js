const freeProxyInfo = [
	{
		question: 'What is the level of anonymity of the proxy?',
		answer:
			'Proxys listed on our site are encrypted and stable. Using a proxy will enable you to access the internet using a different IP address to the one on your computer. Rather than seeing your computers IP address, the internet will see this new IP address, which can be in any location around the world, enabling you to access the internet around the world and access it anonymously.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What is the proxy speed?',
		answer:
			'The proxies listed on our site are lightning fast. There is no difference in the speed of using a proxy server and not using a proxy server. In fact, some proxy servers cache information requests, allowing different users to use this cached information rather than going out to the website host server for the information. This will actually speed up the performance of your computer.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What is a HTTP proxy?',
		answer:
			'HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. HTTP has been used since the nineties and is the industry standard for data transfer on the internet. It takes the form of plain text (or ASCII) messages which are sent by the client requesting the web page and responded to by the host, with the information that allows the client to view the webpage. This is the basics of how webpages work. An HTTP proxy acts in the middle, receiving, reading and then forwarding requests from the client to the webpage server, before receiving, reading and forwarding the responses back to the client. An HTTP is a free proxy and is the most basic form of protection. Lists are updated every ten minutes.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What is a HTTPS proxy?',
		answer:
			'HTTPS web addresses start with https:// instead of http://. They act in the same way as HTTP web addresses but allow the client and the server to agree on a code between them, and then scramble the messages using that code so that no one in between can read the information. This keeps information safe from hackers and anyone else who might be looking to intercept the information. HTTPS are a common form of website that offers more protection than a standard HTTP website. Some proxies only allow proxy users to surf HTTP web addresses. Use our HTTPS proxy list to surf more secure web addresses.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What is a SOCKS proxy?',
		answer:
			'A SOCKS proxy is a general purpose proxy. Where a network has a firewall in place stopping a client from accessing another server, a SOCKS proxy server establishes a TCP connection to the other server on behalf of the client. The server then can route the traffic back and forth between the client and the server through the firewall. While HTTP and HTTPS proxies are great for surfing websites. Socks proxies can be used for any application requiring internet connection such as email, p2p file transfer and online gaming.',
