				Geonode As Your Proxy Provider
			</h2>
			<p>
				Proxies hide your private information and secure your data so it's
				ill-advised to use a free proxy for Safari or even shared proxies. It's
				always better to use exceptional services like Geonode than to avail
				untrustworthy proxies or other internet options and risk your
				information being leaked. If you're on the fence about it, you can try
				Geonode's services at $7 for a week and see if it's suitable for you.
			</p>
			<p>
				So if you don't have a proxy provider or are currently looking to change
				it, Geonode is here for you. It's the one-stop shop for all your proxy
				needs and offers instant activation through dedicated customer service
				on a global scale accompanied with a wide array of tutorials to assist
				you when using our product. Geonode's residential proxies can also
				facilitate any of your web extraction needs from simple web scraping to
				extensive market research and even targeted eCommerce data gathering.
